abstract = {This paper reports results on scrambling gains with fibres and light pipes for linking telescopes to spectrographs aiming high accuracy measurements on radial velocities. The use of the so-called homogenizers is proposed as an alternative or in addition to increase the scrambling gain in optical and mechanical scramblers. The results on a light pipe to homogenize the flux of 4 fibres arranged on a line in order to get a uniform slit aperture is also reported},

@article{Baudrand2001,
abstract = {The transmission modes of a fiber introduce an unstable intensity distribution in high-resolution spectra which cannot be eliminated by flat-fielding because the pattern is sensitive to any small changes in fiber position or illumination. These instabilities, rather than photon shot noise, limit the achievable signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In controlled laboratory experiments at a resolution of ∼150,000, we found S/N limited to ≤500 for a range of fiber perturbations and illumination geometries from simple displacement to simulated seeing variations. We find an empirical relation between the number of monochromatic modes and the level of modal noise for which we offer no rigorous explanation. More important, we demonstrate that continuous, low-amplitude agitation of the fiber close to its output completely eliminates the problem. 1.},

abstract = {High-precision spectrographs play a key role in exoplanet searches and Doppler asteroseismology using the radial velocity technique. The 1 m/s level of precision requires very high stability and uniformity of the illumination of the spectrograph. In fiber-fed spectrographs such as SOPHIE, the fiber-link scrambling properties are one of the main conditions for high precision. To significantly improve the radial velocity precision of the SOPHIE spectrograph, which was limited to 5-6 m/s, we implemented a piece of octagonal-section fiber in the fiber link. We present here the scientific validation of the upgrade of this instrument, demonstrating a real improvement. The upgraded instrument, renamed SOPHIE+, reaches radial velocity precision in the range of 1-2 m/s. It is now fully efficient for the detection of low-mass exoplanets down to 5-10 Earth mass and for the identification of acoustic modes down to a few tens of cm/s.},

@article{Rawson1980,
abstract = {Under certain conditions a changing speckle pattern exists at the output plane of a multimode fiber, resulting in modal noise which can degrade the error performance of a fiber data link. Fiber motion is the usual cause of such speckle change, and Daino et al. have studied the first-order statistics of such modal noise, assuming a single frequency source. But source frequency variation can also cause modal noise; and source frequency diversity has been shown effective in its reduction. In this paper we use a speckle theory approach to study the frequency dependence of modal noise. We have measured and analyzed the correlation of two speckle patterns as a function of source frequency difference, and the speckle spatial frequency distribution as a function of fiber parameters. We have also measured the speckle contrast as a function of fiber length for several sources and fiber types. Such information permits the prediction of the modal noise statistics, from which corresponding changes in error rates can be derived.},

abstract = {A standard multimode optical fiber can be used as a general purpose spectrometer after calibrating the wavelength dependent speckle patterns produced by interference between the guided modes of the fiber. A transmission matrix was used to store the calibration data and a robust algorithm was developed to reconstruct an arbitrary input spectrum in the presence of experimental noise. We demonstrate that a 20 meter long fiber can resolve two laser lines separated by only 8 pm. At the other extreme, we show that a 2 centimeter long fiber can measure a broadband continuous spectrum generated from a supercontinuum source. We investigate the effect of the fiber geometry on the spectral resolution and bandwidth, and also discuss the additional limitation on the bandwidth imposed by speckle contrast reduction when measuring dense spectra. Finally, we demonstrate a method to reduce the spectrum reconstruction error and increase the bandwidth by separately imaging the speckle patterns of orthogonal polarizations. The multimode fiber spectrometer is compact, lightweight, low cost, and provides high resolution with low loss.},

abstract = {Optical fibers are of a great importance in diverse areas of modern observational astronomy. Particularly, in the field of exoplanet detection, they have become an essential part of most current and future instruments because of their filtering and stabilizing capability. In this chapter, we will discuss the use of optical fibers and some limitations in two exoplanet detection methods: nulling interferometry (Section 2) and the radial velocity method (Section 3). We will present simulations, experiments and observations that demonstrate improvements of the instrument performances in the field of exoplanet detection due to the use of optical fibers, as well as some of their limitations.},

@article{Spronck2015,
abstract = {We have designed a fiber scrambler as a prototype for the Keck HIRES spectrograph, using double scrambling to stabilize illumination of the spectrometer and a slicer to increase spectral resolution to R ∼ 70; 000 with minimal slit losses.We find that the spectral line-spread function (SLSF) for the double scrambler observations is 18 times more stable than the SLSF for comparable slit observations and 9 times more stable than the SLSF for a single fiber scrambler that we tested in 2010. For the double scrambler test data, we further reduced the radial velocity scatter from an average of ∼2:1 ms?1 to ∼1:5 ms?1 after adopting a median description of the stabilized SLSF in our Doppler model. This demonstrates that inaccuracies in modeling the SLSF contribute to the velocity rms. Imperfect knowledge of the SLSF, rather than stellar jitter, sets the precision floor for chromospherically quiet stars analyzed with the iodine technique using Keck HIRES and other slit-fed spectrometers. It is increasingly common practice for astronomers to scale stellar noise in quadrature with formal errors such that their Keplerian model yields a $\chi$2 fit of 1.0. When this is done, errors from inaccurate modeling of the SLSF (and perhaps from other sources) are attributed to the star, and the floor of the stellar noise is overestimated.},
